    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook contains utility functions used prior to the implementation of the U-Net. All functions contain doc strings which define the function inputs and outputs, and their data types. There are also comments throughout each function for additional clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "- **[Import Necessary Packages](#import-necessary-packages)**: \n",
    "- **[Internal Functions](#internal-functions)**: Internal or private functions that are only called by other functions and should never be called directly by a script. \n",
    "    - `_display_samples`: Function to plot the given data, whether images or masks.\n",
    "- **[Public Functions](#public-functions)**: Public functions to be imported and called by other scripts, outside of this notebook. \n",
    "    - `custom_warnings`: Function to format warnings in the desired manner\n",
    "    - `load_images_and_masks`: Function to load images and masks from their given directories.\n",
    "    - `remap_mask_classes`: Function to remap mask classes to a subset of the classes. \n",
    "    - `view_data`: Function to view images and/or masks. Calls `_display_samples`.\n",
    "    - `preprocess_images_and_masks`: Function to preprocess and format the data for the U-Net.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "This notebook is not intended to be run individually. The public functions in this notebook should be imported into the `main.ipynb` using the `import-ipynb` package. The purpose of this notebook is to clearly separate and define each utility function that is called internally (in this notebook by one of the other functions) and each utility function that is called in `main.ipynb`."

It is also deceptive in that only the `category` and `message` inputs are explicitly used in our `custom_warnings` function. The remaining required inputs (`filename`, `lineno`) are required by the `warnings` library when formatting warning displays.
